# Capstone Project - Movies and Actor Database

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.9.0

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment
We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the folder where this README doc resides and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the requirements.txt file.
